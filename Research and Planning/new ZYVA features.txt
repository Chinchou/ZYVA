Things that could happen to ZYVA:

-could go to several languages
	-select language from drop down over buttons?
	-change language = switch button set, change
	main title of window

-right click menu for cut/copy/paste
	-this would have to change languages as well...

-undo feature
	-being able to undo typos, both typed and insterted
	by button

-host it somewhere online or make it an online app
	-tricky....
	-still can't find elusive java online thing, and had 
	problems with that last time

-make the background better x)
	-harder than could be believed
	-changable background?

-make the window scalable w/ a full-screen mode
	-math :\

-add an email-to feature, email directly from program?
	-invoke system default app?
		-this would be tricky to do for all OS varients

-make sure clicking buttons doesn't change the focus

-having SHIFT actually change the letters to uppercase versions,
also change the buttons?
