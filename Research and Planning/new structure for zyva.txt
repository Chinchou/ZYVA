New structure for ZYVA:

Main class: creates the program.

Big class: the ZYVA class, which will contain the methods for
setting up the program.

Language classes:  a class per language, with either french
or the language last used being the default choice.  program
will decide which class to use (post initial open) via user input.
Will it make things easier to have an interface for the languages?

Possibility: a separate utility class containing the array(lists) of
characters.  these could also go into the language classes 
themselves.
