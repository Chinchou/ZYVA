Main Idea:  To have the program ("ZYVA") switch easily between French, Spanish, Italian, and German modes.

New features for language implementation:

1) A menu or selection process presented to the user to specify which language the program should use.  This menu will also be available during normal use of the program so that a user can switch languages mid-usage.  Changing the language will involve changing the button set to display/function with the special characters needed for each language and will change the language of the text used in the program.

2) Making the buttons respond to the use of the SHIFT key.  SHIFT will cause the buttons to display and input capitalized characters.

Additional features for ease of usability:

1) An "Undo" feature

2) Make sure that clicking the buttons for special characters does not change the focus of the window (i.e.: eliminate the extra click required to keep typing after pressing a button)

3) A right-click menu for cut, copy, and paste functions.

4) Making the window resizable and adding a "full screen" feature.
